# Medical-Chatbot-with-LLMs

This project aims to develop an advanced, interactive AI chatbot designed to accurately comprehend and respond to inquiries from patients and healthcare staff. By integrating and fine-tuning state-of-the-art open-source language models such as LLama and Mistral, we have customized our chatbot to support the Turkish language, ensuring it delivers precise and useful answers. The chatbot is intended to enhance accessibility and provide valuable assistance to a diverse array of users.
